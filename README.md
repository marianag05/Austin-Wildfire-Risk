# Wildland–Urban Interface & Wildfire Risk in Austin, Texas

**Course Project**: GRG 350E – Geoprocessing  
**Date**: December 9, 2024  

---

## Project Overview
This project analyzes how the proximity of human development to wildland areas influences wildfire vulnerability in Austin, Texas. Using ArcGIS Pro, we assessed the **Wildland–Urban Interface (WUI)** by integrating population density, urban development, and wildfire hazard datasets to identify high-risk neighborhoods.

## Methods & Tools
- **Software**: ArcGIS Pro (geoprocessing, spatial joins, map creation)
- **Data Sources**:
  - Austin Wildland–Urban Interface Code Zones  
  - Austin Neighborhood dataset  
  - Travis County WUI Zones  
  - Travis County Wildfire Hazard Data  
- **Key Steps**:
  1. Imported and organized spatial datasets in ArcGIS Pro  
  2. Clipped features to Austin neighborhood boundaries  
  3. Joined population density data and calculated population per neighborhood  
  4. Identified neighborhoods overlapping high-risk wildfire zones  

---

## Key Findings
- **Robinson Ranch** and **Bluff Springs** are the largest neighborhoods by population within high-risk wildfire zones.  
- Urban growth in WUI areas increases firefighting challenges and heightens risks for both human and natural systems.
